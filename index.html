        { name: 'Diabetes', description: 'The Diabetes project involved developing an advanced machine learning model to predict diabetes using key health indicators such as BMI, glucose levels, and age. The project included comprehensive data preprocessing, addressing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring normalisation to maintain consistency and reliability. Feature engineering was conducted using robust statistical techniques like Q-Q plots, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Spearman rank correlation, enabling the identification of impactful features. Visualisation played a significant role, with intuitive charts created to depict feature dependencies and distributions, enhancing interpretability. The model development leveraged a Voting Classifier comprising five stacked models, utilising bagging techniques to ensure robust and diverse predictions. Performance was rigorously evaluated using accuracy and F1 score metrics to guarantee reliable outcomes. Finally, the model was deployed locally via Flask, providing a seamless and user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS for easy interaction and accessibility.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Diabetes_Predictor', color: '#2ecc71' },
        { name: 'Door dash', description: 'This project involved working with a large dataset of approximately 200,000 rows, utilising statistical tests and datetime manipulation to prepare the data for analysis. The DBSCAN algorithm was implemented to effectively identify and remove outliers, ensuring data quality. Interactive three-dimensional visualisations were created using the Plotly library in Python, providing insightful representations of the data. A neural network was developed using TensorFlow, with its performance evaluated through an epoch-loss graph. The model was further optimised by adjusting hyperparameters and generating 10 different models for comparative evaluation. Finally, the deep learning model’s performance was assessed against a Random Forest Regressor, using mean absolute error as the evaluation metric to ensure robust and accurate predictions.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Door-dash', color: '#3498db' },
        { name: 'A/B testing', description: 'This project focuses on applying A/B testing methodologies to evaluate the performance of two marketing campaigns, providing actionable insights for optimising marketing strategies. Through comprehensive explanatory analysis, key metrics like Impressions, Reach, Purchases, and Cost per Mille (CPM) were compared between control and test groups, revealing disparities in audience engagement, cost efficiency, and purchase behaviour. Visualisation using boxplots highlighted performance variability and outliers, while statistical methods, including the Mann-Whitney U test and Rank-Biserial Correlation, quantified the significance and strength of differences. Time-series analysis uncovered trends in conversion rates, click-through rates, and costs, identifying stability in the test group’s performance but inefficiencies in cost management. Findings revealed that while the test group achieved higher engagement, it failed to translate this into improved conversions, with higher costs and variability compared to the control group.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/AB-Testing', color: '#e74c3c' },
        { name: 'Clinical trial', description: 'This project analysed the effectiveness of three pain relief treatments Acetaminophen, Codeine, and Ibuprofen across different age groups (Young Adults, Adults, and Seniors) using advanced statistical methods. Key analyses included effect size calculations (Cohen\'s d), non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Kruskal-Wallis), and post-hoc pairwise comparisons (Dunn\'s Test). Results showed significant pain reduction for all treatments, with Ibuprofen offering the highest overall effectiveness, while Acetaminophen performed best for Seniors, and Codeine was most effective for Adults.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Clinical-trials', color: '#e74c3c' },
        { name: 'Med insurance', description: 'This project involves building machine learning models to predict medical insurance costs, focusing on the comparison between neural network models and a random forest model. The process included handling missing data, utilising TensorFlow to develop neural networks, and tracking model performance through graphs of absolute error loss across epochs. The models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of Determination (R²), achieving a value of 0.88, indicating strong predictive accuracy. The neural networks outperformed the random forest model, effectively capturing patterns in the data for more accurate predictions. This project demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning techniques to predict medical insurance costs, optimising model performance while managing complexities inherent in the data.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Medical-insurance', color: '#3498db' },
	{ name: 'Roulette', description: 'This project developed a Python simulation of a roulette wheel to model bet outcomes and probabilities with precision. The project incorporated game theory strategies, including the Martingale and Fibonacci methods, to simulate and evaluate different betting approaches. Using Plotly, I visualised the results to compare the effectiveness of various strategies, providing valuable insights into their performance and potential risks.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Roulette-simulation-', color: '#800080' },
        { name: 'Forecasting', description: 'In this project, I forecasted the British Pound (GBP) to US Dollar (USD) exchange rate using multiple time series modelling techniques. The analysis started with data pre-processing, including calculating autocorrelation and applying the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to ensure stationarity. I conducted seasonal decomposition to visually explore the components of the time series, followed by fitting Autoregressive (AR) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, which provided useful insights but were less effective compared to more advanced methods. I then applied Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Monte Carlo simulations. The HMM approach yielded remarkably accurate predictions, while XGBoost performed very well, providing valuable results with high predictive power. The combination of these methods enabled me to forecast the GBP to USD exchange rate with increased accuracy, providing a detailed comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This project highlights my ability to leverage statistical models, machine learning techniques, and simulations for time series forecasting and predictive analytics.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Forecasting', color: '#800080' },
	{ name: 'Loans', description: 'This project focused on constructing a loan approval model utilising 12 key features, including marital status and credit score, to predict loan outcomes effectively. Rigorous statistical tests such as Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney-U, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov were conducted to select the most impactful features, ensuring model reliability. Dependencies between features and loan status were visualised through comprehensive charts and graphs, enhancing interpretability. A Stacked Classifier integrating seven models was employed, with Singular Value Decomposition applied for dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter optimisation achieved using advanced techniques like gradient descent, grid search, and Bayesian methods. The model performance was thoroughly evaluated using F1 score, confusion matrix, accuracy, ROC curve, and AUC metrics, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.', link: 'https://github.com/kj22a/Loan-Prediction', color: '#2ecc71' }
